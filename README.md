# Machine-Learning

- Data analyzing and processing
- Features Correlation Analysis
- Feature transformation
- Evaluation measures haven been applied
- Splitting data into(training - validation - test)
- Hyperparameter tunning
  - To choose the most fitted hyperparameters for testing
- Dealing with imbalanced classes
- Mutiple classifier have been testes (to comprehend how each classifiers perform better on a particular sections):
  - used classifier include:
    - KNN (KD-trees due to reasonable number of features)
    - Linear regression
    - Decision Trees
    - Data ensembling:
      - Random Forest
      - Bagging
      - Ada boost
   
- Error Analysis
- Test predictions
